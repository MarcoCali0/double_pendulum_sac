# Introduction
The double pendulum is a classic problem in dynamics and control theory, known for its chaotic behavior. This project aims to implement solutions for two specific configurations:
- Acrobot: A two-link robotic arm with the first link fixed at the base.
- Pendubot: A two-link robot where both links can move freely.

By employing the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, we aim to achieve efficient swingup and stabilization of non-linear systems.
